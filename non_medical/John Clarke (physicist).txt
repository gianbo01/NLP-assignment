John Clarke (physicist)

John Clarke (born 10 February 1942) is a British physicist and a Professor of Experimental Physics at University of California at Berkeley.
Clarke received BA, MA, and Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Cambridge namely Christ's College, Cambridge and Darwin College, Cambridge in 1964, 1968, and 1968, respectively.He has made significant contributions in superconductivity and superconducting electronics, particularly in the development and application of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which are ultrasensitive detectors of magnetic flux. One current project is the application of SQUIDs configured as quantum-noise limited amplifiers to search for the axion, a possible component of dark matter.Clarke was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1986.  He was awarded the Comstock Prize in Physics in 1999 and the Hughes Medal in 2004. He was elected a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences in May 2012. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2017
