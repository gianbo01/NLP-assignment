Brookesia peyrierasi

Similar species
A 1999 paper in the Journal of Zoology disputed a 1995 paper which considered this species and B. tuberculata to be the same species as B. minima.  The later paper discussed the same details as the first – subtle morphological differences in the hemipenises of the respective species and determined they were not conspecific.  They also found differences in the arrangement of head crests and in minute spines above the eyes.

Habitat
The natural habitat of B. peyrierasi is forest.

Reproduction
B. peyrierasi is oviparous.
