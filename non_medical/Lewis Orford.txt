He played more regularly for the first team in 1887 but remained as a lower-order batsman, despite an innings of 76 when batting at No 10 in a high-scoring match against Sussex. The 1887 University Match was his final match in first-class cricket.Orford had graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1886, before his final season for the cricket team.
