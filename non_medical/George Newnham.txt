He was called to the bar on 3 February 1757.Newnham's father recommended his son to the Duke of Newcastle for a seat in Parliament in 1761, but the Duke appeared to exclude him from opportunities at Lewes.

At the 1774 general election, he was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Arundel on the interest of Sir John Shelley.
