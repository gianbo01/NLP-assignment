Müggelberge

The Müggelberge (also formerly called the Müggelsberge; English: Muggle Mountains) are a wooded line of hills with heights up to 114.7 m above sea level (NHN) in the southeast of Berlin's Treptow-Köpenick quarter. They are dominated by the Kleiner Müggelberg (88.3 m) and Großer Müggelberg (114.7 m). The Müggelberge cover an area of around seven square kilometres. The ridge was formed during the ice age.

A viewing tower called the Müggelturm has been erected on the hills with a view of the Müggelsee and the Berlin-Müggelberge TV Tower.
