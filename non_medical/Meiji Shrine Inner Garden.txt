During the Meiji period, the garden came under the supervision of the Imperial Household Agency and named Yoyogi Gyoen (Yoyogi Imperial Garden) and was frequently visited by Emperor Meiji and Empress Shōken. The garden contains a tea house, an arbour, a fishing stand and an iris garden. It has an area of 83,000 square meters and is open to the public throughout the year.
