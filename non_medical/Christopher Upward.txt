Christopher Upward

Christopher Upward (14 November 1938 – 4 August 2002) was an English orthographer, notable for designing the system of cut spelling, a system of English-language spelling reform which reduces redundant letters and makes substitutions to improve correspondence with the spoken word, as well as for the book The History of English Spelling, which was unfinished at the time of his death, but was completed by George Davidson and published posthumously in 2011.

Biography
