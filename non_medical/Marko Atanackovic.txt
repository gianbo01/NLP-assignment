Career
Club career
Brought up in Djurg√•rdens IF's system, the goalkeeper spent almost an entire career in lower leagues of Sweden. He played over 100 league games each for both Arameisk-Syrianska IF and IK Frej before finally getting a try at playing abroad. Signing for lowly Czech club 1. SC Znojmo FK, the contract was soon annulled due to irregularities with the player agent. 
He played the spring season for another Swedish low-level club before moving to Greece in the summer of 2019. In the Super League Greece 2, he debuted in a fully professional league at the age of 33 for Panachaiki GE. 
As the team imploded, he went home to Sweden again to join third-tier Sollentuna FK. In June 2020, Atanackovic was accused of playing large sums of money on matches he himself had played in. Atanackovic, however, denied the allegations, stating that he did not want to play in a club that came with false accusations against him and for that reason he left the club shortly after his arrival.
