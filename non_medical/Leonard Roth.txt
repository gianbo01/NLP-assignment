Leonard Roth

Leonard Roth (29 August 1904 Edmonton, London, England – 28 November 1968 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) was a mathematician working in the Italian school of algebraic geometry. He introduced an example of a unirational variety that was not rational (though his proof that it was not rational was incomplete).
Roth was educated at Latymer Upper School, Dulwich College and Clare College, Cambridge, where he graduated as a Wrangler in 1926. His sister was Queenie Roth, literary critic and wife of F. R. Leavis.
