Echioceratidae

Echioceratidae is an extinct family of ammonites that lived during Sinemurian stage of Early Jurassic.

Description
Ammonites belonging to this family are characterised by serpenticone shells with a keel, which can be surrounded by grooves if a species is densely ribbed and compressed. The whorl section is either circular or has flat sides. Ribs are simple and strong with the exception of Leptechioceras which instead possessed a strongly compressed, smooth outer whorl. The initial ontogenical stage of these ammonites is typically smooth but very short. Tubercules are represented in a few genera within this group.
