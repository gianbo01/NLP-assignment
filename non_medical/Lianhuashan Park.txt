Statue of Deng Xiaoping
A 6-meter-high statue of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping stands on a hilltop at the center of the park and dominates the monumental perspective of Futian, marking the northern end of an axial composition that evokes urban design patterns of Imperial China.: 1514  It was created by sculptor Teng Wenjing following a 1995 decision by the Shenzhen Municipal Committee to erect a memorial to Deng that would be inaugurated on the 20th anniversary of Shekou Special Economic Zone. As the project generated controversy, the statue was kept for some time in a warehouse as its fate remained unclear until it was eventually unveiled in November 2000 in the presence of CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin.: 1513 The statue shows Deng walking briskly, a reference to his words that "The step of reform and opening-up should be bigger." On its pedestal is a calligraphy by Deng's successor Jiang Zemin.The statue was visited by Premier Li Keqiang in 2015 and by CCP general secretary Xi Jinping in 2020 as they paid homage to Deng's role in Shenzhen's development.
