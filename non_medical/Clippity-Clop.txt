Plot
The protagonists, a little old man and a lady load goods, a parrot, that squawks throughout the story, and a cat, that miaows throughout the story, onto two donkeys. They then attempt to move the donkeys without success. The man ignores the lady's warning and, resorts to using a whip to move his donkey. The donkey doesn't like this, and runs away. The man chases after the donkey, eventually catches it, and entices the donkey to follow him with carrots. The donkey eats so many carrots that the man has to carry it. Meanwhile, the lady, who was left behind, reappears riding her donkey, having tied a carrot to her whip to encourage the donkey to move. She overtakes the man with her donkey happily chasing the carrot, and the cat is also pleased.
