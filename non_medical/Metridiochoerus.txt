Metridiochoerus

Metridiochoerus is an extinct genus of swine known from the Pliocene and Pleistocene of Africa. It is also known as the giant warthog.

Chronology
The oldest specimen dates to around 3.4 million years ago from the Usno Formation in Ethiopia. It probably evolved from a recent immigrant from Eurasia, which has been suggested to be the European "Postpotamochoerus" provincialis. The youngest remains of the genus date to the Late Pleistocene in southern Africa (Zimababwe, and possibly South Africa).

Description
Metridiochoerus was a large animal, 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) in length, resembling a giant warthog. It had two large pairs of tusks which were pointed sideways and curved upwards. The teeth, especially the third molars, become increasingly high crowned (hypsodont) in later species.

Ecology
The various species are usually thought to have been grazers, though this has been questioned for the earliest low crowned species.
