Enchanted Storybook Castle

Enchanted Storybook Castle is a castle in Shanghai Disneyland. Similarly to the Castle of Magical Dreams in Hong Kong Disneyland, it represents all of the Disney Princesses and not only one.  Additionally, it is the tallest castle in all of the related Disney theme parks. It replaced Walt Disney World’s Cinderella Castle as the tallest castle in any Disney Park.
The look of Enchanted Storybook Castle was inspired by many other Disney Castles, including Cinderella Castle and Sleeping Beauty Castle. Features include a walk-through attraction, a Disney character dining restaurant, and a boat-themed attraction inside the castle. On the tallest tower, there is a peony flower sculpture to represent Shanghai, giving voice to the motto of the Theme Park:  'Authentically Disney, Distinctly Chinese.'
