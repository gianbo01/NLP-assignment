Disney's Nightmare in the Sky

Disney's Nightmare in the Sky (Traditional Chinese: 「魔咒焚城」煙花表演) was a fireworks show that took place during 2010 Disney's Haunted Halloween at Hong Kong Disneyland.

History
Prior to 2010 Disney's Haunted Halloween, the evening's fireworks show was the original Disney in the Stars show, with the addition of a Halloween-themed finale. Nightmare in the Sky was created by Disney's Creative Entertainment division specifically for the event, first premiering in 2010. The show was mixed with Walt Disney World Resort's HalloWishes and Disneyland Resort's Halloween Screams. It is hosted by Maleficent from Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty.
