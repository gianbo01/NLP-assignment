He then taught medicine at Westminster Hospital. He took a keen interest in entomology, collecting specimens from across England, many of which were considered rarities. Edward Newman called him the "Indefatigable Power" for his perseverance and effort taken to collect rare species of beetle from remote locations. He carried bottles and boxes for collecting insects bundled into bag inserted inside his top hat and wore a formal tail coat into the field, and on occasion, the contents of his top hat would fall out when raising it to greet a lady. A paralytic stroke reduced his activity in later life.Power married Helena Margaret, daughter of Rev. George Bitton Jermyn.
