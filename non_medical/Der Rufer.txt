Der Rufer (lit.â€‰'The Caller') is a bronze sculpture by Gerhard Marcks created in 1967. Casts of the original sculpture are located in Bremen, Berlin and Perth. The statue is of a barefooted man in a robe, cupping his hands to his mouth as if shouting.

The Perth statue was dedicated to victims and survivors of torture in 1998.Shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall, a cast of the statue was installed near the Brandenburg Gate in  Tiergarten in Berlin. The inscription contains a message of peace.
