Asukayama Park

Asukayama Park (飛鳥山公園, Asukayama Kōen) is a public park in Kita, Tokyo, Japan.

History
In the early eighteenth century, shōgun Tokugawa Yoshimune planted many cherry trees in the area and opened up the land for the enjoyment of the "Edokko" or citizens of Tokyo. The park was formally established, alongside Ueno Park, Shiba Park, Asakusa Park, and Fukagawa Park, in 1873 by the Dajō-kan, as Japan's first public parks. In 1998, three museums were opened inside the park, designed by AXS Satow: the Kita City Asukayama Museum (北区飛鳥山博物館), the Shibusawa Memorial Museum (渋沢史料館), and the Paper Museum (紙の博物館).

Preserved railway vehicles
The park is home to two preserved railway vehicles: former Toei 6000 series tram car number 6080 and JNR Class D51 steam locomotive number D51 853.

Access
The closest station to the park is Ōji Station on the JR Keihin-Tohoku Line. A small inclined monorail called the Asukayama Park Monorail (飛鳥山公園モノレール) is provided on the north side of the park to provide access free-of-charge to the park for the mobility-impaired.
