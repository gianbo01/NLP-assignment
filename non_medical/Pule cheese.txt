Pule cheese

Pule cheese or magareći sir, is a Serbian cheese made from 60% Balkan donkey milk and 40% goat's milk.The cheese is produced in Zasavica Nature Reserve.
Pule is reportedly the "world's most expensive cheese", fetching US$1300 per kilogram. It is so expensive because of its difficulty to produce, and its rarity: there are only about 100 jennies in the landrace of Balkan donkeys that are milked for Pule-making and it takes 25 litres (6+1⁄2 US gal) of milk to create one kilogram (2 lb 3 oz) of cheese. Among its devoted enthusiasts is Novak Djokovic, who was once rumored to have purchased the entire supply, although he refuted this claim.The taste of Pule cheese is reputed to be similar to that of manchego, a combination of nutty and earthy flavors, accompanied by a crumbly texture.
