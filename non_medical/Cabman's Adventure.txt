The film was produced by his company, Towarzystwo Udziałowe Pleograf. It was an experimental film and one of the first films made by him. The film features two characters, a passager played by Kazimierz Junosza-Stępowski, and a cabman, whose actor's name remains uncertain, though it is presumed to be Władysław Neubelt.
