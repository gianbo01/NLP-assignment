Tommy Söderberg

Tommy Söderberg (born 19 August 1948) is a Swedish football manager and coach.

Career
As a manager, he won the Swedish league title with AIK in 1992. Later he went on to coach the Swedish U21 national team, and when Tommy Svensson left his job as national team manager in 1998, the path was open for Söderberg. He took Sweden to the Euro 2000 tournament. The same year Lars Lagerbäck was promoted from assistant coach to joint coach together with Söderberg.
Under management of the new coaching duo, Sweden qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2004. During the 2004 European Championship, Söderberg decided to leave his position after the tournament and return to coach the U21 team, which he later managed together with Jörgen Lennartsson.
