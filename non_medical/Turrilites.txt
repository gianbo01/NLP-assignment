Turrilites

Turrilites is a genus of helically coiled ammonoid cephalopods from the lower part of the Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian and Turonian); generally included in the Ancyloceratina. Previously (Arkell, 1957) it was included in the ammonoid suborder, Lytoceratina.
The shell of Turrilites is tightly wound in a high trochospiral, with an acute angle at the apex. Ribs are weak to strong and may have 3 or 4 rows of equal numbers of tubercles. Thought to be derived from Mariella. Includes three subgenera.
