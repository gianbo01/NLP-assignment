Mammuthus creticus

Mammuthus creticus, or the Cretan dwarf mammoth, is an extinct species of dwarf mammoth endemic to Crete. It is only known from a single locality near Chania, which probably dates to the Early or Middle Pleistocene. With a shoulder height of about 1 metre (3.3 ft) and a weight of about 180 kilograms (400 lb), it was the smallest mammoth that ever existed. Its size reduction was the result of insular dwarfism, where the body size of large mammals on islands reduces as the result of decreased food availability, predation and competition. It was originally described as Elephas creticus by Dorothea Bate in 1907. After DNA research published in 2006, it was proposed to rename Elephas creticus into Mammuthus creticus (Bate, 1907). Others proposed (in 2002) to rename all the described specimens of larger size under the new subspecies name Elephas antiquus creutzburgi (Kuss, 1965). A 2007 study criticised the results of the 2006 DNA study, showing that the DNA research was likely flawed. However, morphological data supports a placement in Mammuthus. It probably derived from Mammuthus meridionalis, or less likely, Mammuthus rumanus. It was one of only three mammal species native to Crete during the Early Pleistocene and the early Middle Pleistocene, alongside the dwarf hippopotamus Hippopotamus creutzburgi and the giant rat Kritimys.
