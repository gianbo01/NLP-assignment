The initial two phases of construction concluded in 2000 and 2006, and were carried out by landscape architect Michel Corajoud. The project was managed by Grand Lyon. The park was renamed to Parc Henry-Chabert on 19 December 2020.The park includes several playgrounds, a skatepark and a botanical garden.
