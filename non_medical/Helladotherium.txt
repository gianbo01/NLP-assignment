Helladotherium

Helladotherium is an extinct genus of sivatherine giraffid from Europe, Africa, and Asia during the Miocene.  The most complete skeleton is that of a female, based on a comparison with an intact female Sivatherium giganteum skull.
Only two species of Helladotherium have been discovered, with H. grande being larger than H. duvernoyi. The former has been found only in Pakistan.
