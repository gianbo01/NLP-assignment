The gateway serves the first section of Chapultepec Park, a public park in Mexico City.

Calzada Juventud Heroica starts at the gateway. It is connected to the 1975 Bridge of the Lions (which crosses Circuito Interior) and reaches the Altar a la Patria.
It was named after the two lion bronze sculptures that lie on granite Art Deco plinths; the mineral came from Germany, Canada and Zacatecas. The plinths serve as if they were entrance guardhouses.
