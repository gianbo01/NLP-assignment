Hawks' sportive lemur

Hawks' sportive lemur (Lepilemur tymerlachsoni), also known as the Nosy Be sportive lemur or Nosy Be weasel lemur, is a sportive lemur endemic to Madagascar.  It is a moderately large sportive lemur, with a total length of about 50 to 68 cm (20 to 27 in), of which 22 to 27 cm (8.7 to 10.6 in) are tail.The name honors the Howard and Rhonda Hawk family. Originally named L. tymerlachsoni, the name was corrected to L. tymerlachsonorum in 2009. However, this correction was based on the incorrect assumption that the name was based on a husband and wife team. Because the name is a compilation of bits of names, the original singular form was correct.
