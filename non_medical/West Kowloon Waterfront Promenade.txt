West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade

West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade (Chinese: 西九龍海濱長廊) is a promenade running alongside Victoria Harbour on reclaimed land in Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon peninsula of Hong Kong. It opened to the public on 17 September 2005.The promenade starts at the junction of Nga Cheung Road (雅翔道) and Austin Road West, outside the toll gate leading to the Western Harbour Crossing.
As the West Kowloon Cultural District project has remained stagnant after a long debate, the Hong Kong Government constructed a promenade on unused reclamed land. The promenade is decorated with pillars of wind chimes and illuminated paintings as well as calligraphy invarious styles.
