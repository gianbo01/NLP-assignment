Frühlingsanlagen München

The Frühlingsanlagen (spring gardens) is a park in the Au quarter of Munich.
The gardens extend along the right bank of the Isar from the Wittelsbacherbrücke/Humboldtstraße to the diversion of the Kleine Isar north of the Reichenbachbrücke. It is bordered to the south-east by Eduard-Schmidt-Straße and Claude-Lorrain-Straße. The area measures around 16.3 ha, including an 835 m long and 5.8 ha large riparian strip that is part of the flood bed of the renaturalised Isar.
The Eduard-Schmid-Straße recreational park and the administration of Munich's municipal nursery are located in the gardens. The Freibadbächl which is mostly underground, flows openly through the grounds over a distance of around 165 metres from Humboldtstraße to the municipal nursery. South of the Reichenbach Bridge, on the edge of the children's playground, is a fountain created by Wolf Hirtreiter in 1972. The Weideninsel (an island in the Isar) is at the same level as the municipal nursery.
