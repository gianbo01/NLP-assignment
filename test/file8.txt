Los Angeles
Los Angeles (US: /lɔːs ˈændʒələs/ ⓘ lawss AN-jəl-əs;
Spanish: Los Ángeles [los ˈaŋxeles], lit. 'The Angels'), often
referred to by its initials L.A.,
[13] officially the City of Los
Angeles, is the most populous city in the U.S. state of
California. With roughly 3.9 million residents within the city
limits as of 2020,
[7] Los Angeles is the second-most populous
city in the United States, behind only New York City; it is the
commercial, financial and cultural center of the Southern
California region. Los Angeles has a Mediterranean climate,
an ethnically and culturally diverse population, in addition to
a sprawling metropolitan area.
The majority of the city proper lies in a basin in Southern
California adjacent to the Pacific Ocean in the west and
extending partly through the Santa Monica Mountains and
north into the San Fernando Valley, with the city bordering
the San Gabriel Valley to its east. It covers about 469 square
miles (1,210 km2
),[6] and is the county seat of Los Angeles
County, which is the most populous county in the United
States with an estimated 9.86 million residents as of
2022.
[14] It is the third-most visited city in the U.S. with over
4.6 million visitors as of 2019.[15]
The area that became Los Angeles was originally inhabited by
the indigenous Tongva people and later claimed by Juan
Rodríguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542. The city was founded
on September 4, 1781, under Spanish governor Felipe de
Neve, on the village of Yaanga.
[16] It became a part of Mexico
in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848,
at the end of the Mexican–American War, Los Angeles and
the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo and became part of the United States.
Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4,
1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The
discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the
city.[17] The city was further expanded with the completion of
the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which delivers water from
Eastern California.
Los Angeles has a diverse economy with a broad range of
industries, best known as the home of the Hollywood film
industry, the world's largest by revenue; the city was an
important site in the history of film. It also has one of the
busiest container ports in the Americas.[18][19][20] In 2018,
the Los Angeles metropolitan area had a gross metropolitan
product of over $1.0 trillion,[21] making it the city with the
third-largest GDP in the world. Los Angeles hosted the
Summer Olympics in 1932 and 1984, and will also host in
2028. More recently, statewide droughts in California have
strained both the city's and Los Angeles County's water
security.

On September 4, 1781, a group of 44 settlers known as "Los
Pobladores" founded the pueblo (town) they called El Pueblo
de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles, 'The Town of Our
Lady the Queen of the Angels'.[24] The original name of the
settlement is disputed; the Guinness Book of World Records
rendered it as "El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los
Ángeles de Porciúncula";[25] other sources have shortened or
alternate versions of the longer name.[26]
The local English pronunciation of the name of the city has
varied over time. A 1953 article in the journal of the
American Name Society asserts that the pronunciation /lɔːs
ˈændʒələs/ lawss AN-jəl-əs was established following the
1850 incorporation of the city and that since the 1880s the
pronunciation /loʊs ˈæŋɡələs/ lohss ANG-gəl-əs emerged
from a trend in California to give places Spanish, or Spanishsounding, names and pronunciations.[27] In 1908, librarian
Charles Fletcher Lummis, who argued for the name's
pronunciation with a hard g (/ɡ/),[28][29] reported that there
were at least 12 pronunciation variants.[30] In the early
1900s, the Los Angeles Times advocated for pronouncing it
Loce AHNG-hayl-ais (/loʊs ˈɑːŋheɪleɪs/), approximating
Spanish [los ˈaŋxeles], by printing the respelling under its
masthead for several years.[31] This did not find favor.[32]
Since the 1930s, /lɔːs ˈændʒələs/ has been most common.[33]
In 1934, the United States Board on Geographic Names
decreed that this pronunciation be used.[31] This was also
endorsed in 1952 by a "jury" appointed by Mayor Fletcher
Bowron to devise an official pronunciation.[27][31]
Common pronunciations in the United Kingdom include /lɒs
ˈændʒɪliːz, -lɪz, -lɪs/ loss AN-jil-eez, -iz, -iss.
[34] Phonetician
Jack Windsor Lewis described the most common one, /lɒs
ˈændʒɪliːz/ ⓘ , as a spelling pronunciation based on
analogy to Greek words ending in -‍es, "reflecting a time when
the classics were familiar if Spanish was not".[35]
The settlement of Indigenous Californians in the modern Los
Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley was dominated
by the Tongva (now also known as the Gabrieleño since the
era of Spanish colonization). The historic center of Tongva
power in the region was the settlement of Yaanga (Tongva:
Iyáangẚ), meaning "place of the poison oak", which would

Maritime explorer Juan
Rodríguez Cabrillo
claimed the area of
southern California for
the Spanish Empire in 1542 while on an official military
exploring expedition moving northward along the Pacific
coast from earlier colonizing bases of New Spain in Central
and South America.[40] Gaspar de Portolà and Franciscan
missionary Juan Crespí reached the present site of Los
Angeles on August 2, 1769.[41]
In 1771, Franciscan friar
Junípero Serra directed
the building of the
Mission San Gabriel
Arcángel, the first
mission in the area.[42]
On September 4, 1781, a
group of 44 settlers
known as "Los
Pobladores" founded the
pueblo (town) they called
El Pueblo de Nuestra
Señora la Reina de los
Ángeles, 'The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels'.[24]
The present-day city has the largest Roman Catholic
archdiocese in the United States. Two-thirds of the Mexican
or (New Spain) settlers were mestizo or mulatto, a mixture of
African, indigenous and European ancestry.[43] The
settlement remained a small ranch town for decades, but by
1820, the population had increased to about 650
residents.[44] Today, the pueblo is commemorated in the
historic district of Los Angeles Pueblo Plaza and Olvera
Street, the oldest part of Los Angeles.[45]
New Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish
Empire in 1821, and the pueblo now existed within the new
Mexican Republic. During Mexican rule, Governor Pío Pico
made Los Angeles, Alta California's regional capital.
[46] By
this time, the new republic introduced more secularization
acts within the Los Angeles region.[47] In 1846, during the

Californio statesman Pío Pico, who
served as the last Mexican governor
of California, played an influential
role in the development of Los
Angeles in the late Mexican and
early American eras.
The Treaty of Cahuenga, signed in
1847 by Californio Andrés Pico and
American John C. Frémont, ended the
U.S. Conquest of California.
In the early 20th century, Hollywood
studios, like Paramount Pictures,
helped transform Hollywood into the
world capital of film and helped
solidify LA as a global economic
hub.
States occupied the
pueblo. This resulted in
the siege of Los Angeles
where 150 Mexican
militias fought the
occupiers which eventually surrendered.[48]
Mexican rule ended during following the American Conquest of
California, part of the larger Mexican-American War. Americans took
control from the Californios after a series of battles, culminating with
the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on January 13, 1847.[49] The
Mexican Cession was formalized in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in
1848, which ceded Los Angeles and the rest of Alta California to the
United States.
Railroads arrived with the
completion of the
transcontinental Southern
Pacific line from New Orleans to
Los Angeles in 1876 and the Santa Fe Railroad in 1885.[50]
Petroleum was discovered in the city and surrounding area in 1892,
and by 1923, the discoveries had helped California become the
country's largest oil producer, accounting for about one-quarter of
the world's petroleum output.[51]
By 1900, the population had grown to more than 102,000,[52]
putting pressure on the city's water supply.
[53] The completion of the
Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, under the supervision of William Mulholland, ensured the continued growth
of the city.[54] Because of clauses in the city's charter that prevented the City of Los Angeles from selling or
providing water from the aqueduct to any area outside its borders, many adjacent cities and communities
felt compelled to join Los Angeles.[55][56][57]
Los Angeles created the first municipal zoning ordinance in the United
States. On September 14, 1908, the Los Angeles City Council
promulgated residential and industrial land use zones. The new
ordinance established three residential zones of a single type, where
industrial uses were prohibited. The proscriptions included barns,
lumber yards, and any industrial land use employing machine-powered
equipment. These laws were enforced against industrial properties after
the fact. These prohibitions were in addition to existing activities that
were already regulated as nuisances. These included explosives
warehousing, gas works, oil drilling, slaughterhouses, and tanneries.
Los Angeles City Council also designated seven industrial zones within
the city. However, between 1908 and 1915, the Los Angeles City Council
created various exceptions to the broad proscriptions that applied to
these three residential zones, and as a consequence, some industrial
uses emerged within them. There are two differences between the 1908
Residence District Ordinance and later zoning laws in the United
States. First, the 1908 laws did not establish a comprehensive zoning
map as the 1916 New York City Zoning Ordinance did. Second, the
residential zones did not distinguish types of housing; they treated
apartments, hotels, and detached-single-family housing equally.[58]
In 1910, Hollywood merged into Los Angeles, with 10 movie companies already operating in the city at the
time. By 1921, more than 80 percent of the world's film industry was concentrated in L.A.[59] The money
generated by the industry kept the city insulated from much of the economic loss suffered by the rest of the
Post-Conquest era

country during the Great Depression.
[60] By 1930, the population surpassed one million.[61] In 1932, the
city hosted the Summer Olympics.
During World War II Los Angeles was a major center of wartime
manufacturing, such as shipbuilding and aircraft. Calship built
hundreds of Liberty Ships and Victory Ships on Terminal Island, and
the Los Angeles area was the headquarters of six of the country's major
aircraft manufacturers (Douglas Aircraft Company, Hughes Aircraft,
Lockheed, North American Aviation, Northrop Corporation, and
Vultee). During the war, more aircraft were produced in one year than
in all the pre-war years since the Wright brothers flew the first airplane
in 1903, combined. Manufacturing in Los Angeles skyrocketed, and as
William S. Knudsen, of the National Defense Advisory Commission put
it, "We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of
production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed
possible."[62]
After the end of World War II Los Angeles grew more rapidly than ever,
sprawling into the San Fernando Valley.
[63] The expansion of the
Interstate Highway System during the 1950s and 1960s helped propel
suburban growth and signaled the demise of the city's electrified rail system, once the world's largest.
As a consequence of World War II, suburban growth, and population density, many amusement parks were
built and operated in this area.[64] An example is Beverly Park, which was located at the corner of Beverly
Boulevard and La Cienega before being closed and substituted by the Beverly Center.
[65]
Racial tensions led to the Watts riots in 1965, resulting in 34 deaths and over 1,000 injuries.[66]
In 1969, California became the birthplace of the Internet, as the first
ARPANET transmission was sent from the University of California, Los
Angeles (UCLA) to the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park.
[67]
In 1973, Tom Bradley was elected as the city's first African American
mayor, serving for five terms until retiring in 1993. Other events in the
city during the 1970s included the Symbionese Liberation Army's South
Central standoff in 1974 and the Hillside Stranglers murder cases in
1977–1978.[68]
In early 1984, the city surpassed Chicago in population, thus becoming
the second largest city in the United States.
In 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second
time. Despite being boycotted by 14 Communist countries, the 1984 Olympics became more financially
successful than any previous,[69] and the second Olympics to turn a profit; the other, according to an
analysis of contemporary newspaper reports, was the 1932 Summer Olympics, also held in Los Angeles.[70]
Racial tensions erupted on April 29, 1992, with the acquittal by a Simi Valley jury of four Los Angeles
Police Department (LAPD) officers captured on videotape beating Rodney King, culminating in large-scale
riots.
[71][72]
In 1994, the magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake shook the city, causing $12.5 billion in damage and 72
deaths.[73] The century ended with the Rampart scandal, one of the most extensive documented cases of
police misconduct in American history.[74]

In 2002, Mayor James Hahn led the campaign against secession, resulting in
voters defeating efforts by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood to secede
from the city.[75]
In 2022, Karen Bass became the city's first female mayor, making Los Angeles
the largest U.S. city to have ever had a woman as mayor.[76]
Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games,
making Los Angeles the third city to host the Olympics three times.[77][78]
The city of Los Angeles covers a total area of 502.7 square miles (1,302 km2
),
comprising 468.7 square miles (1,214 km2
) of land and 34.0 square
miles (88 km2
) of water.[79] The city extends for 44 miles (71 km) from
north to south and for 29 miles (47 km) from east to west. The
perimeter of the city is 342 miles (550 km).
Los Angeles is both flat and hilly. The highest point in the city proper is
Mount Lukens at 5,074 ft (1,547 m),[80][81] located at the northeastern
end of the San Fernando Valley. The eastern end of the Santa Monica
Mountains stretches from Downtown to the Pacific Ocean and
separates the Los Angeles Basin from the San Fernando Valley. Other
hilly parts of Los Angeles include the Mt. Washington area north of
Downtown, eastern parts such as Boyle Heights, the Crenshaw district
around the Baldwin Hills, and the San Pedro district.
Surrounding the city are much higher mountains. Immediately to the
north lie the San Gabriel Mountains, which is a popular recreation area
for Angelenos. Its high point is Mount San Antonio, locally known as
Mount Baldy, which reaches 10,064 feet (3,068 m). Further afield, the
highest point in southern California is San Gorgonio Mountain, 81
miles (130 km) east of downtown Los Angeles,[82]
 with a height of 11,503 feet (3,506 m).
The Los Angeles River, which is largely seasonal, is the primary drainage channel. It was straightened and
lined in 51 miles (82 km) of concrete by the Army Corps of Engineers to act as a flood control channel.[83]
The river begins in the Canoga Park district of the city, flows east from the San Fernando Valley along the
north edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, and turns south through the city center, flowing to its mouth in
the Port of Long Beach at the Pacific Ocean. The smaller Ballona Creek flows into the Santa Monica Bay at
Playa del Rey.
Los Angeles is rich in native plant species partly because of its diversity
of habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains. The most
prevalent plant communities are coastal sage scrub, chaparral
shrubland, and riparian woodland.
[84] Native plants include: the
California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Ceanothus, Chamise, Coast
Live Oak, sycamore, willow and Giant Wildrye. Many of these native
species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to
be considered endangered. Although it is not native to the area, the
official tree of Los Angeles is the Coral Tree (Erythrina caffra)
[85] and
the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise (Strelitzia

reginae).[86] Mexican Fan Palms, Canary Island Palms, Queen Palms, Date Palms, and California Fan
Palms are common in the Los Angeles area, although only the last is native to California, though still not
native to the City of Los Angeles.
Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes because of its location on the
Pacific Ring of Fire. The geologic instability has produced numerous
faults, which cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes annually in
Southern California, though most of them are too small to be felt.[87]
The strike-slip San Andreas Fault system, which sits at the boundary
between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, passes through
the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The segment of the fault passing
through Southern California experiences a major earthquake roughly
every 110 to 140 years, and seismologists have warned about the next
"big one", as the last major earthquake was the 1857 Fort Tejon
earthquake.
[88] The Los Angeles basin and metropolitan area are also
at risk from blind thrust earthquakes.
[89] Major earthquakes that have hit the Los Angeles area include the
1933 Long Beach, 1971 San Fernando, 1987 Whittier Narrows, and the 1994 Northridge events. All but a
few are of low intensity and are not felt. The USGS has released the UCERF California earthquake forecast,
which models earthquake occurrence in California. Parts of the city are also vulnerable to tsunamis; harbor
areas were damaged by waves from Aleutian Islands earthquake in 1946, Valdivia earthquake in 1960,
Alaska earthquake in 1964, Chile earthquake in 2010 and Japan earthquake in 2011.[90]
The skyline of Downtown Los Angeles
The city is divided into many different districts and neighborhoods,[91][92] some of which were
incorporated cities that have merged with Los Angeles.[93] These neighborhoods were developed
piecemeal, and are well-defined enough that the city has signage which marks nearly all of them.[94]
The city's street patterns generally follow a grid plan, with uniform block lengths and occasional roads that
cut across blocks. However, this is complicated by rugged terrain, which has necessitated having different
grids for each of the valleys that Los Angeles covers. Major streets are designed to move large volumes of
traffic through many parts of the city, many of which are extremely long; Sepulveda Boulevard is 43 miles
(69 km) long, while Foothill Boulevard is over 60 miles (97 km) long, reaching as far east as San
Bernardino. Drivers in Los Angeles suffer from one of the worst rush hour periods in the world, according
to an annual traffic index by navigation system maker, TomTom. LA drivers spend an additional 92 hours
in traffic each year. During the peak rush hour, there is 80% congestion, according to the index.[95]

Los Angeles (Downtown)
Climate chart (explanation)
Los Angeles is often characterized by the presence of low-rise buildings,
in contrast to New York City. Outside of a few centers such as
Downtown, Warner Center, Century City, Koreatown, Miracle Mile,
Hollywood, and Westwood, skyscrapers and high-rise buildings are not
common in Los Angeles. The few skyscrapers built outside of those
areas often stand out above the rest of the surrounding landscape. Most
construction is done in separate units, rather than wall-to-wall.
However, Downtown Los Angeles itself has many buildings over 30
stories, with fourteen over 50 stories, and two over 70 stories, the
tallest of which is the Wilshire Grand Center. Also Los Angeles is
increasingly becoming a city of apartments rather than single-family
dwellings, especially in the dense inner city and Westside
neighborhoods.

Los Angeles has a two-season Mediterranean climate
of dry summer and very mild winter (Köppen Csb on
the coast and most of downtown, Csa near the
metropolitan region to the west), but it receives less
annual precipitation than most other Mediterranean
climates, so it is near the boundary of a semi-arid
climate (BSh), though narrowly missing it.[97]
Daytime temperatures are generally temperate all
year round. In winter, they average around 68 °F

Autumn months tend to be hot, with major heat

and experience more precipitation. Los Angeles has
plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an
average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation

hours of sunshine per day in December to an average
of 12 in July.[103]
Due to the mountainous terrain of the surrounding region, the Los Angeles area contains a large number of
distinct microclimates, causing extreme variations in temperature in close physical proximity to each other.
For example, the average July maximum temperature at the Santa Monica Pier is 70 °F (21 °C) whereas it
is 95 °F (35 °C) in Canoga Park, 15 miles (24 km) away.[104] The city, like much of the Southern Californian
coast, is subject to a late spring/early summer weather phenomenon called "June Gloom". This involves
overcast or foggy skies in the morning that yield to sun by early afternoon.[105]
More recently, statewide droughts in California have further strained
the city's water security.
[23] Downtown Los Angeles averages 14.67 in
(373 mm) of precipitation annually, mainly occurring between
November and March,[106][101] generally in the form of moderate rain
showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall during winter storms. Rainfall
is usually higher in the hills and coastal slopes of the mountains
because of orographic uplift. Summer days are usually rainless. Rarely,
an incursion of moist air from the south or east can bring brief
thunderstorms in late summer, especially to the mountains. The coast
gets slightly less rainfall, while the inland and mountain areas get
considerably more. Years of average rainfall are rare. The usual pattern is a year-to-year variability, with a
short string of dry years of 5–10 in (130–250 mm) rainfall, followed by one or two wet years with more
than 20 in (510 mm).[101] Wet years are usually associated with warm water El Niño conditions in the
Pacific, dry years with cooler water La Niña episodes. A series of rainy days can bring floods to the lowlands
and mudslides to the hills, especially after wildfires have denuded the slopes.
Both freezing temperatures and snowfall are extremely rare in the city basin and along the coast, with the
last occurrence of a 32 °F (0 °C) reading at the downtown station being January 29, 1979;[101] freezing
temperatures occur nearly every year in valley locations while the mountains within city limits typically
receive snowfall every winter. The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2.0 inches
(5 cm) on January 15, 1932.[101][107] While the most recent snowfall occurred in February 2019, the first
snowfall since 1962,[108][109] with snow falling in areas adjacent to Los Angeles as recently as January
2021.[110] Brief, localized instances of hail can occur on rare occasions, but are more common than
snowfall. At the official downtown station, the highest recorded temperature is 113 °F (45 °C) on September

officially recorded is 121 °F (49 °C), on September 6, 2020, at the
weather station at Pierce College in the San Fernando Valley
neighborhood of Woodland Hills.
[112] During autumn and winter, Santa
Ana winds sometimes bring much warmer and drier conditions to Los
Angeles, and raise wildfire risk.

Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los
Angeles/Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air
pollution in the form of smog. The Los Angeles Basin and the San
Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which
holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives,
shipping, manufacturing, and other sources.[120] The percentage of
small particle pollution (the kind that penetrates into the lungs)
coming from vehicles in the city can get as high as 55 percent.
The smog season lasts from approximately May to October.[121] While other large cities rely on rain to clear
smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches (380 mm) of rain each year: pollution accumulates over many
consecutive days. Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early
national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act. When the act was passed, California was
unable to create a State Implementation Plan that would enable it to meet the new air quality standards,

largely because of the level of pollution in Los Angeles generated by
older vehicles.[122] More recently, the state of California has led the
nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low-emission
vehicles. Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years
because of aggressive steps to reduce it, which include electric and
hybrid cars, improvements in mass transit, and other measures.
The number of Stage 1 smog alerts in Los Angeles has declined from
over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new
millennium.[123] Despite improvement, the 2006 and 2007 annual
reports of the American Lung Association ranked the city as the most
polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution.[124] In 2008,
the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year-round particulate
pollution.[125] The city met its goal of providing 20 percent of the city's power from renewable sources in
2010.[126] The American Lung Association's 2013 survey ranks the metro area as having the nation's worst
smog, and fourth in both short-term and year-round pollution amounts.[127]
Los Angeles is also home to the nation's largest urban oil field. There are more than 700 active oil wells
within 1,500 feet (460 m) of homes, churches, schools and hospitals in the city, a situation about which the
EPA has voiced serious concerns.[128]
The city has an urban population of bobcats (Lynx rufus).[129] Mange is a common problem in this
population.[129] Although Serieys et al. 2014 find selection of immune genetics at several loci they do not
demonstrate that this produces a real difference which helps the bobcats to survive future mange
outbreaks.

[133]
Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 1,838,822 persons (48.5%). Los Angeles is home to people from
more than 140 countries speaking 224 different identified languages.[136] Ethnic enclaves like Chinatown,
Historic Filipinotown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, Little Ethiopia, Tehrangeles, Little Tokyo, Little
Bangladesh, and Thai Town provide examples of the polyglot character of Los Angeles.
Non-Hispanic Whites were 28.7% of the population in 2010,[133]
compared to 86.3% in 1940.[134] The majority of the Non-Hispanic
White population is living in areas along the Pacific coast as well as in
neighborhoods near and on the Santa Monica Mountains from the
Pacific Palisades to Los Feliz.
Mexican ancestry makes up the largest ethnic group of Hispanics at
31.9% of the city's population, followed by those of Salvadoran (6.0%)
and Guatemalan (3.6%) heritage. The Hispanic population has a long
established Mexican-American and Central American community and
is spread well-nigh throughout the entire city of Los Angeles and its
metropolitan area. It is most heavily concentrated in regions around
Downtown as East Los Angeles, Northeast Los Angeles and Westlake.
Furthermore, a vast majority of residents in neighborhoods in eastern
South Los Angeles towards Downey are of Hispanic origin.
The largest Asian ethnic groups are Filipinos (3.2%) and Koreans (2.9%), which have their own established
ethnic enclaves—Koreatown in the Wilshire Center and Historic Filipinotown.
[137] Chinese people, which
make up 1.8% of Los Angeles's population, reside mostly outside of Los Angeles city limits and rather in the
San Gabriel Valley of eastern Los Angeles County, but make a sizable presence in the city, notably in
Chinatown.
[138] Chinatown and Thaitown are also home to many Thais and Cambodians, which make up
0.3% and 0.1% of Los Angeles's population, respectively. The Japanese comprise 0.9% of LA's population
and have an established Little Tokyo in the city's downtown, and another significant community of

make up 0.9% of the city's population. The city is also home to
Armenians, Assyrians, and Iranians, many of whom live in enclaves
like Little Armenia and Tehrangeles.
African Americans have been the predominant ethnic group in South
Los Angeles, which has emerged as the largest African American
community in the western United States since the 1960s. The
neighborhoods of South Los Angeles with highest concentration of
African Americans include Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills, Leimert Park,
Hyde Park, Gramercy Park, Manchester Square and Watts.
[139]
Apart from South Los Angeles, neighborhoods in the Central region
of Los Angeles, as Mid-City and Mid-Wilshire have a moderate
concentration of African Americans as well. There is a sizeable
Eritrean and Ethiopian community in the Fairfax region.[140]
Los Angeles has the second largest Mexican, Armenian, Salvadoran,
Filipino and Guatemalan population by city in the world, the third
largest Canadian population in the world, and has the largest
Japanese, Iranian/Persian, Cambodian and Romani (Gypsy)
population in the country.[141] The Italian community is concentrated in San Pedro.[142]
Most of Los Angeles' foreign born population were born in Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, the Philippines

According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center,
Christianity is the most prevalently practiced religion in Los
Angeles (65%).[144][145] The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
Los Angeles is the largest archdiocese in the country.[146]
Cardinal Roger Mahony, as the archbishop, oversaw
construction of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which
opened in September 2002 in Downtown Los Angeles.[147]
In 2011, the once common, but ultimately lapsed, custom of
conducting a procession and Mass in honor of Nuestra Señora
de los Ángeles, in commemoration of the founding of the City
of Los Angeles in 1781, was revived by the Queen of Angels
Foundation and its founder Mark Albert, with the support of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles as well as
several civic leaders.[148] The recently revived custom is a continuation of the original processions and
Masses that commenced on the first anniversary of the founding of Los Angeles in 1782 and continued for
nearly a century thereafter.
With 621,000 Jews in the metropolitan area, the region has the second-largest population of Jews in the
United States, after New York City.
[149] Many of Los Angeles's Jews now live on the Westside and in the
San Fernando Valley, though Boyle Heights once had a large Jewish population prior to World War II due
to restrictive housing covenants. Major Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods include Hancock Park, PicoRobertson, and Valley Village, while Jewish Israelis are well represented in the Encino and Tarzana
neighborhoods, and Persian Jews in Beverly Hills. Many varieties of Judaism are represented in the greater
Los Angeles area, including Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, and Reconstructionist. The Breed Street Shul
in East Los Angeles, built in 1923, was the largest synagogue west of Chicago in its early decades; it is no
longer in daily use as a synagogue and is being converted to a museum and community center.[150][151] The
Kabbalah Centre also has a presence in the city.[152]

The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel was founded in Los
Angeles by Aimee Semple McPherson in 1923 and remains headquartered
there to this day. For many years, the church convened at Angelus Temple,
which, at its construction, was one of the largest churches in the country.[153]
Los Angeles has had a rich and influential
Protestant tradition. The first Protestant
service in Los Angeles was a Methodist
meeting held in a private home in 1850 and
the oldest Protestant church still operating,
First Congregational Church, was founded
in 1867.[154] In the early 1900s the Bible
Institute Of Los Angeles published the
founding documents of the Christian
Fundamentalist movement and the Azusa
Street Revival launched
Pentecostalism.
[154] The Metropolitan
Community Church also had its origins in the Los Angeles area.[155]
Important churches in the city include First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, Bel Air Presbyterian
Church, First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles, West Angeles Church of God in Christ,
Second Baptist Church, Crenshaw Christian Center, McCarty Memorial Christian Church, and First
Congregational Church.
The Los Angeles California Temple, the second-largest temple operated
by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is on Santa Monica
Boulevard in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Dedicated in

Saints built in California and it was the largest in the world when
completed.[156]
The Hollywood region of Los Angeles also has several significant
headquarters, churches, and the Celebrity Center of
Scientology.
[157][158]
Because of Los Angeles's large multi-ethnic population, a wide variety
of faiths are practiced, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam,
Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, Baháʼí, various Eastern Orthodox Churches,
Sufism, Shintoism, Taoism, Confucianism, Chinese folk religion and countless others. Immigrants from
Asia for example, have formed a number of significant Buddhist congregations making the city home to the
greatest variety of Buddhists in the world. The first Buddhist joss house was founded in the city in
1875.[154] Atheism and other secular beliefs are also common, as the city is the largest in the Western U.S.
Unchurched Belt.
As of January 2020, there are 41,290 homeless people in the City of Los Angeles, comprising roughly 62%
of the homeless population of LA County.[159] This is an increase of 14.2% over the previous year (with a
12.7% increase in the overall homeless population of LA County).[160][161] The epicenter of homelessness in
Los Angeles is the Skid Row neighborhood, which contains 8,000 homeless people, one of the largest
stable populations of homeless people in the United States.[162][163] The increased homeless population in
Los Angeles has been attributed to lack of housing affordability[164] and to substance abuse.[165] Almost 60
percent of the 82,955 people who became newly homeless in 2019 said their homelessness was because of
economic hardship.[160] In Los Angeles, black people are roughly four times more likely to experience
homelessness.[160][166]

Los Angeles is the second-largest city in the United States but hosted no
NFL team between 1995 and 2015. At one time, the Los Angeles area
hosted two NFL teams: the Rams and the Raiders. Both left the city in
1995, with the Rams moving to St. Louis, and the Raiders moving back
to their original home of Oakland. After 21 seasons in St. Louis, on
January 12, 2016, the NFL announced the Rams would be moving back
to Los Angeles for the 2016 NFL season with its home games played at
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for four seasons.[228][229][230]
Prior to 1995, the Rams played their home games in the Coliseum from
1946 to 1979 which made them the first professional sports team to play
in Los Angeles, and then moved to Anaheim Stadium from 1980 until
1994. The San Diego Chargers announced on January 12, 2017, that
they would also relocate back to Los Angeles (the first since its
inaugural season in 1960) and become the Los Angeles Chargers beginning in the 2017 NFL season and
played at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California for three seasons.[231] The Rams and the
Chargers would soon move to the newly built SoFi Stadium, located in nearby Inglewood during the 2020
season.[232]
Los Angeles boasts a number of sports venues, including Dodger

Los Angeles is a charter city as opposed to a general law city. The current
charter was adopted on June 8, 1999, and has been amended many times.[244]
The elected government consists of the Los Angeles City Council and the
mayor of Los Angeles, which operate under a mayor–council government, as
well as the city attorney (not to be confused with the district attorney, a county
office) and controller. The mayor is Karen Bass.
[245] There are 15 city council
districts.
The city has many departments and appointed officers, including the Los
Angeles Police Department (LAPD),[246]
the Los Angeles Board of Police
Commissioners,
[247]
the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD),
[248]
the
Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA),[249]
the Los Angeles
Department of Transportation (LADOT),[250] and the Los Angeles Public
Library (LAPL).[251]
The charter of the City of Los Angeles ratified by voters in 1999 created a
system of advisory neighborhood councils that would represent the diversity of
stakeholders, defined as those who live, work or own property in the
neighborhood. The neighborhood councils are relatively autonomous and spontaneous in that they identify
their own boundaries, establish their own bylaws, and elect their own officers. There are about 90
neighborhood councils.
Residents of Los Angeles elect supervisors for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th supervisorial districts.
In the California State Assembly, Los Angeles is split between fourteen districts.[252] In the California State
Senate, the city is split between eight districts.[253] In the United States House of Representatives, it is split
among nine congressional districts.[254]
In 1992, the city of Los Angeles recorded 1,092 murders.[255] Los
Angeles experienced a significant decline in crime in the 1990s and late
2000s and reached a 50-year low in 2009 with 314 homicides.[256][257]
This is a rate of 7.85 per 100,000 population—a major decrease from
1980 when a homicide rate of 34.2 per 100,000 was reported.[258][259]
This included 15 officer-involved shootings. One shooting led to the
death of a SWAT team member, Randal Simmons, the first in LAPD's
history.[260] Los Angeles in the year of 2013 totaled 251 murders, a
decrease of 16 percent from the previous year. Police speculate the drop
resulted from a number of factors, including young people spending
more time online.[261] In 2021, murders rose to the highest level since
2008 and there were 348.[262]
In 2015, it was revealed that the LAPD had been under-reporting crime for eight years, making the crime
rate in the city appear much lower than it really was.[263][264]
The Dragna crime family and the Cohen crime family dominated organized crime in the city during the
Prohibition era[265] and reached its peak during the 1940s and 1950s with the "Battle of Sunset Strip" as
part of the American Mafia, but has gradually declined since then with the rise of various black and

450 gangs.[266] Among them are the Crips and Bloods, which are both African American street gangs that
originated in the South Los Angeles region. Latino street gangs such as the Sureños, a Mexican American
street gang, and Mara Salvatrucha, which has mainly members of Salvadoran descent, as well as other
Central American descents, all originated in Los Angeles. This has led to the city being referred to as the
"Gang Capital of America".[267]

9) and KTLA-TV (Channel 5), also operate in the area.
There are also a number of smaller
regional newspapers, alternative
weeklies and magazines, including
the Los Angeles Register, Los
Angeles Community News, (which
focuses on coverage of the greater
Los Angeles area), Los Angeles Daily News (which focuses coverage on
the San Fernando Valley), LA Weekly, L.A. Record (which focuses
coverage on the music scene in the Greater Los Angeles Area), Los
Angeles Magazine, the Los Angeles Business Journal, the Los Angeles
Daily Journal (legal industry paper), The Hollywood Reporter, Variety
(both entertainment industry papers), and Los Angeles Downtown
News.
[310] In addition to the major papers, numerous local periodicals serve immigrant communities in
their native languages, including Armenian, English, Korean, Persian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese,
Hebrew, and Arabic. Many cities adjacent to Los Angeles also have their own daily newspapers whose
coverage and availability overlaps with certain Los Angeles neighborhoods. Examples include The Daily
Breeze (serving the South Bay), and The Long Beach Press-Telegram.
Los Angeles arts, culture and nightlife news is also covered by a number of local and national online guides,
including Time Out Los Angeles, Thrillist, Kristin's List, DailyCandy, Diversity News Magazine, LAist,
and Flavorpill.
[311][312][313][314]
The city and the rest of the Los Angeles metropolitan area are served by
an extensive network of freeways and highways. Texas Transportation
Institute's annual Urban Mobility Report ranked Los Angeles area
roads the most congested in the United States in 2019 as measured by
annual delay per traveler, area residents experiencing a cumulative
average of 119 hours waiting in traffic that year.[315] Los Angeles was
followed by San Francisco/Oakland, Washington, D.C., and Miami.
Despite the congestion in the city, the mean daily travel time for
commuters in Los Angeles is shorter than other major cities, including
New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. Los Angeles's mean travel
time for work commutes in 2006 was 29.2 minutes, similar to those of
San Francisco and Washington, D.C.[316]
The major highways that connect LA to the rest of the nation include
Interstate 5, which runs south through San Diego to Tijuana in Mexico and north through Sacramento,
Portland, and Seattle to the Canada–US border; Interstate 10, the southernmost east–west, coast-to-coast
Interstate Highway in the United States, going to Jacksonville, Florida; and U.S. Route 101, which heads to
the California Central Coast, San Francisco, the Redwood Empire, and the Oregon and Washington coasts.

The Los Angeles Metro Rail is
operated by LACMTA.
Union Station is served by Amtrak
California, Metrolink, and Metro Rail.
Los Angeles Intl. Airport (LAX) is the
4th busiest airport in the world.
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA
County Metro) and other smaller regional agencies operate an extensive
system of bus lines, as well as subway and light rail lines across Los
Angeles County, with a combined monthly ridership (measured in
individual boardings) of 38.8 million as of September 2011. The
majority of this (30.5 million) is taken up by the city's bus system,[317]
the second busiest in the country. The subway and light rail combined
average the remaining roughly 8.2 million boardings per month.[317] LA
County Metro recorded over 397 million boardings for the 2017
calendar year, including about 285 million bus riders and about
113 million riding on rail transit.[318] For the first quarter of 2018, there
were just under 95 million system-wide boardings, down from about
98 million in 2017, and about 105 million in 2016.[319] In 2005, 10.2%
of Los Angeles commuters rode some form of public transportation.[320] According to the 2016 American
Community Survey, 9.2% of working Los Angeles (city) residents made the journey to work via public
transportation.[321]
The city's subway system is the ninth busiest in the United States and
its light rail system is the country's busiest.
[322] The rail system
includes the B and D subway lines, as well as the A, C, E, and K light rail
lines. In 2016, the E Line was extended to the Pacific Ocean at Santa
Monica. The Metro G and J lines are bus rapid transit lines with stops
and frequency similar to those of light rail. As of 2022, the total number
of light rail stations is 99. The city is also central to the commuter rail
system Metrolink, which links Los Angeles to all neighboring counties
as well as many suburbs.[323]
Besides the rail service provided by Metrolink and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, Los Angeles is served by inter-city passenger trains from Amtrak. The main rail station in the
city is Union Station just north of Downtown.
In addition, the city directly contracts for local and commuter bus service through the Los Angeles
Department of Transportation, or LADOT.
The main international and domestic airport serving Los Angeles is Los
Angeles International Airport (IATA: LAX, ICAO: KLAX), commonly
referred to by its airport code, LAX.
[324] It is located on the Westside of
Los Angeles near the Sofi Stadium in Inglewood.
Other major nearby commercial airports include:
(IATA: ONT, ICAO: KONT) Ontario International Airport, owned by
the city of Ontario, CA; serves the Inland Empire.[325]
(IATA: BUR, ICAO: KBUR) Hollywood Burbank Airport, jointly
owned by the cities of Burbank, Glendale, and Pasadena. Formerly known as Bob Hope Airport and
Burbank Airport, the closest airport to Downtown Los Angeles serves the San Fernando, San Gabriel,
and Antelope Valleys.[326]
(IATA: LGB, ICAO: KLGB) Long Beach Airport, serves the Long Beach/Harbor area.[327]
(IATA: SNA, ICAO: KSNA) John Wayne Airport of Orange County.
One of the world's busiest general-aviation airports is also in Los Angeles: Van Nuys Airport (IATA: VNY,
ICAO: KVNY).[328]

The Port of Los Angeles is in San Pedro Bay in the San Pedro
neighborhood, approximately 20 miles (32 km) south of Downtown.
Also called Los Angeles Harbor and WORLDPORT LA, the port
complex occupies 7,500 acres (30 km2
) of land and water along 43
miles (69 km) of waterfront. It adjoins the separate Port of Long
Beach.
[329]
The sea ports of the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach
together make up the Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbor.
[330][331]
Together, both ports are the fifth busiest container port in the world,
with a trade volume of over 14.2 million TEU's in 2008.[332] Singly, the
Port of Los Angeles is the busiest container port in the United States
and the largest cruise ship center on the West Coast of the United States – The Port of Los Angeles's World
Cruise Center served about 590,000 passengers in 2014.[333]
There are also smaller, non-industrial harbors along Los Angeles's coastline. The port includes four
bridges: the Vincent Thomas Bridge, Henry Ford Bridge, Long Beach International Gateway Bridge, and
Commodore Schuyler F. Heim Bridge. Passenger ferry service from San Pedro to the city of Avalon (and
Two Harbors) on Santa Catalina Island is provided by Catalina Express.
