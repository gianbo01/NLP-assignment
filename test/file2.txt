Procedural sedation and analgesia
Procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) is a technique
in which a sedating/dissociative medication is given, usually
along with an analgesic medication, in order to perform nonsurgical procedures on a patient. The overall goal is to induce a
decreased level of consciousness while maintaining the
patient's ability to breathe on their own. Airway protective
reflexes are not compromised by this process [1] and therefore endotracheal intubation is not
required. PSA is commonly used in the emergency department, in addition to the operating room.
This technique is often used in the emergency department for the performance of painful or
uncomfortable procedures. Common purposes include:
laceration repair
setting fractures
draining abscesses
reducing dislocations
performing endoscopy
for cardioversion[2]
during various dental procedures
during transesophageal echocardiogram
and certain imaging or minor procedures where the patient is unable (or unwilling) to keep still
—especially children
There are no absolute reasons that immediately disqualify a patient from receiving PSA. However,
a patient's age, medical comorbidities, or evidence of a difficult airway are important
considerations.
Although there is no age limit for PSA, the elderly have a greater chance of complications such as
longer than intended sedation time, increased sensitivity to medications, adverse effects of
medications, and higher than expected drug levels due to difficulty clearing the drugs. To help
reduce risk of complications, consider a less aggressive approach to PSA, including starting with a
smaller dose than given for non-elderly patients, giving the medication slowly, giving repeat doses
of the medications less often.[3]

Patients with serious medical conditions are at greater chance for negative side effects after
receiving PSA. Examples of comorbidities include heart failure, COPD, neuromuscular disease. Use
the ASA Classification to predict a patient's risk for serious complications from PSA, such as
hypotension or respiratory depression. Generally, patients with ASA Class III or greater are more
likely to develop such complications. Similar to previously described, consider starting with a
smaller dose, giving the medication slowly, and giving repeat doses of the medications less often to
decrease risk of complications associated with comorbidities.[3]
An airway is assessed by the patient's ability or the physician's ability to oxygenate (provide
oxygen) or ventilate (exhale carbon dioxide). Examples of a difficult airway include a thick
neck/obese patient, head and neck structural abnormalities, and lung disease. The problem is not
that the patient will not respond appropriately to medications, as is the case with older patients or
those with medical comorbidities, but that if there is a complication, it will be more difficult for the
physician to protect the patient's airway and save them from complications. It is generally advised
to consider alternatives to PSA if the patient is assessed to have a difficult airway. Measures such as
reducing starting dose, giving drugs slowly, and redosing less frequently will not change risk of
PSA complications in a patient with a difficult airway.[3]
While procedural sedation is often used to avoid airway intervention, sedation is a continuum and
a patient can easily slip into a deeper state. For this reason, a physician who is performing PSA
should be prepared to care for a patient at least one level of sedation greater than that intended.[1]
In order to do this, a practitioner must be able to recognize the level of sedation and understand
the increasing cardiopulmonary risk that is associated with deeper sedation.[4]
The American Society of Anesthesiologists defines the continuum of sedation as follows:[5]

There is another type of sedation known as dissociative sedation. It causes profound amnesia but
allows spontaneous respiration, cardiopulmonary stability, and airway reflexes are still intact.
Ketamine is a commonly used drug that can cause this type of sedation.[4]

Sedative agents
Propofol
20/11/23, 21:18 Procedural sedation and analgesia - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_sedation_and_analgesia 3/7
Propofol[6]
is a non-barbiturate derivative that is thought to act by stimulating inhibitory GABA
receptors and blocking excitatory NMDA receptors. It takes 40 seconds for the effects of propofol
to kick in, and effects last six minutes.[3] Propofol has both sedative and amnestic effects, but
provides no analgesia. Adverse effects to look out for include hypotension (low blood pressure) and
respiratory depression, manifested as mild drops in oxygen saturation levels. Propofol is also
painful when administered intravenously, therefore, lidocaine is commonly used as a pretreatment
to help decrease the pain associated with administering propofol. Additionally, it has antiemetic
properties that are also useful in these types of procedures.[7]
Etomidate is an imidazole derivative, commonly used for the induction of general anesthesia.
Effects kick in almost immediately, within 5–15 seconds, and last 5–15 minutes.[3] Etomidate
carries sedative effects only; it does not provide pain relief. Side effects of etomidate include
myoclonus (involuntary muscle jerking) and respiratory depression. One of the major benefits of
etomidate is that it does not cause cardiovascular or respiratory instability.[7] This makes it a
potentially more preferable choice for those with already lower blood pressure.
Midazolam[6]
is a benzodiazepine that acts by stimulating inhibitory GABA receptors. Effects are
seen within 2–5 minutes, and last 30–60 minutes.[7][3] Its main effect is anxiolysis, helping to
reduce feelings of anxiety, and amnestic effects, helping the patient to forget memories associated
with the procedure. It provides no analgesia, so it was commonly used with fentanyl for effective
PSA prior to propofol and etomidate. Midazolam collects in the body's fatty tissues, so a possible
complication includes prolonged sedation. As a result, the elderly, the obese, and those with kidney
or liver disease are more vulnerable to prolonged sedation with midazolam. Respiratory depression
is also associated with midazolam when given in high doses.
Ketamine is a dissociative sedative, meaning it takes the patient into a dream-like level of
consciousness. Effects occur within 30 seconds, and last 5–20 minutes.[7] Ketamine has sedative,
analgesic, and amnestic properties, but most of its uses today are focused on analgesia. Some of the
benefits of ketamine is that it does not compromise the patient's airway protective reflexes, keeps
the upper airway muscle tone, and allows for spontaneous breathing. A common side effect of
ketamine is emergence reactions. The patient may become disoriented, entranced, or experience
hallucinations. Although usually benign, these reactions may also be frightening for the patient.
Other reported complications include fast heart rate, elevated blood pressure, nausea, vomiting,
and laryngospasm, but usually in the context of oropharyngeal manipulation.

Dexmedetomidine

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_sedation_and_analgesia 4/7
Dexmedetomidine is a more recent agent used in this process. It is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist
that causes sedation and does have some analgesic properties. It has minimal effect on respiratory
function. It will affect cardiac function as the dose increases.[7]
Opioids are used to suppress pain by acting primarily on μ-opioid receptors (MOR) in addition to
various other opioid receptors located within the central nervous system. They will cause some
dose dependent cardiopulmonary suppression.[7] They have addictive properties and have led to
the opioid epidemic. When used for procedural sedation these are started at low dose then titrated
to reach the desired effect.[1]
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, 75-125 times stronger than morphine,[3] that acts by activating
opioid receptors in the nervous system. Its effects begin in 2–3 minutes, and last 30–60 minutes.
Fentanyl provides analgesia and sedative properties; it does not have any amnestic effects. It was
commonly used with midazolam for effective PSA prior to propofol and etomidate. The major
complication of fentanyl is respiratory depression, which can be made worse when given with other
sedative agents.
Ketamine, as stated above, has both analgesic and sedative properties and can be useful as an
alternative analgesic agent; small doses of ketamine have been found to be safer than fentanyl
when used in combination with propofol.[8]
Any patient undergoing anaesthesia must be pre-assessed for risk using a classification system,
such as the one devised by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). In addition to preassessment, the patients medical history should be taken with special attention to history of
anaesthesia. These things contribute to the ASA physical status classification system. This system
starts at ASA 1 which is a healthy individual and escalates to ASA 6 which is a brain dead
individual.[4]
It is safe to perform sedation in the emergency room on patients who are ASA 1 or 2.
If the patient is ASA 3 or 4 additional resources might be needed, such as a person with more
training in procedural sedation, an anesthesiologist.[1] Furthermore, before a qualified anesthesia
professional performs PSA, an Informed consent should be completed.[4]
Airway assessment is one of the most important parts of the physical exam when done as part of
the pre-procedure work-up. There is always a risk that a patient is sedated more heavily than
intended and consequently require some sort of airway intervention. Therefore, the anesthetist
should perform an airway exam that includes a Mallampati score, mouth opening assessment, and
Thyromental distance. If the patient is deemed to have a difficult airway, there should be adequate
resources if airway intervention is required. These includes things like a Glidescope, fiberscope
optic, and an intubating Laryngeal mask airway.
[4]
It is important to keep track of the patient's vital signs, especially oxygen saturation and blood
pressure [1] when giving PSA to ensure adequate cardiopulmonary function. Monitors are also
useful for PSA safety. These include cardiac monitoring such as electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry,
blood pressure cuff, and an end tidal carbon dioxide monitor.[4][9] Deep sedation resulting in

Patient being monitored following
anesthesia
respiratory depression can cause some quantitative changes to these monitors, hence why it is
important to monitor them. One of the first things that can be seen is a rise in end tidal carbon
dioxide. This happens well before a drop in oxygen saturation. Depending on the how substantial
the respiratory depression, the physician can use supplemental oxygen or other airway
interventions to stabilize the patient.[4] Visual assessment is also an important part of PSA. To
quantify the level of consciousness, the physician uses different levels of stimulation and observes
the patient's response.
There is a theoretical concern that performing PSA on a patient with food in their stomach can
increase the risk of aspiration. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest clinically significant risk
of aspiration of stomach contents if performing PSA on a patient with recent food intake. In fact,
there is evidence to suggest that fasting is not required to prevent aspiration in most cases.[10]
However, when possible, fasting is still preferred.[1] For most agents, the patient should have had
nothing to eat for at least six hours. Clear fluids can be allowed up to two hours before the
procedure. One can consider using ketamine if there is a high risk of aspiration, given ketamine
does not compromise protective airway reflexes. However, in the emergency department setting,
PSA is usually administered without waiting the full six hours, unless there is clear evidence that
the patient may not be able to maintain his/her airway on their own.[11]
There are a few criteria for discharging a patient who has
undergone procedural sedation. The recovery time for a patient
to be ready for discharge varies but is typically 60–120
minutes. The criteria are as follows:
1. Patient must be stable from a cardiovascular standpoint
and have an open airway.
2. The patient should be easy to arouse and have intact
reflexes such as a gag and cough reflex.
3. They should be approaching their baseline in terms of
talking and sitting up.
4. The patient should be properly hydrated.
5. In a special population patient, such as a very young or
mentally disabled patient, they should be about as
responsive as they were pre-sedation.[12]
PSA can cause several complications. These include allergic reactions, over-sedation, respiratory
depression, and hemodynamic effects. These typically depend on the sedative agent used. Some
agents are more likely to cause complications than others, but all sedative agents can cause
complications if not used properly. Titration is a common technique used to reduce these
complications. Additionally, some agents have antagonists, reversal agents, that can be used to

reverse the effects or reduce the amount of sedation. Additionally, a person is assigned to monitor
the status of the patient and should be able to recognize the complications of PSA. Their ability to
alert others and respond accordingly reduces complications.[1]
Some resistance to sedation techniques used outside the operating room by non-anesthetists has
been voiced.[13]
