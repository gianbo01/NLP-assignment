Lists of medical eponyms

Medical eponyms are terms used in medicine which are named after people (and occasionally places or things). In 1975, the Canadian National Institutes of Health held a conference that discussed the naming of diseases and conditions. The conclusion, as summarized in The Lancet, was this: "The possessive use of an eponym should be discontinued, since the author neither had nor owned the disorder."However, because of the nature of the history of medicine, new discoveries are often referred to using the name of the people who initially made the discovery.
