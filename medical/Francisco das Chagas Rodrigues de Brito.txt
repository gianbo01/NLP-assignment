Crimes
The case of poor children being killed in the capital city of São Luís was brought to light in 2004 with the murder of minor Jonahtan dos Santos, who, before disappearing, had said that he would meet with the mechanic.

Two bones were also found on the grounds of the house in which he lived.The lack of clarification on these homicides, carelessly treated for over the years, led Brazil to be denounced by organizations at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, of the OAS.Francisco das Chagas Rodrigues de Brito's crimes also extended to the state of Pará, with a suspected total of 42 children being killed and emasculated.In his crimes, the murderer, who exhibited psychopathic characteristics (sought to justify himself, lacked pity and lied), sexually abused his victims and, after killing them, mutilated them by cutting off their ears, fingers and then emasculating them.
