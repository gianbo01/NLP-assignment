Erythema

Erythema (from Greek erythros 'red') is redness of the skin or mucous membranes, caused by hyperemia (increased blood flow) in superficial capillaries. It occurs with any skin injury, infection, or inflammation. Examples of erythema not associated with pathology include nervous blushes.

Types
Erythema ab igne
Erythema chronicum migrans
Erythema induratum
Erythema infectiosum (or fifth disease)
Erythema marginatum
Erythema migrans
Erythema multiforme (EM)
Erythema nodosum
Erythema toxicum
Erythema elevatum diutinum
Erythema gyratum repens
Keratolytic winter erythema
Palmar erythema

Causes
It can be caused by infection, massage, electrical treatment, acne medication, allergies, exercise, solar radiation (sunburn), photosensitization, acute radiation syndrome, mercury toxicity, blister agents, niacin administration, or waxing and tweezing of the hairsâ€”any of which can cause the capillaries to dilate, resulting in redness. Erythema is a common side effect of radiotherapy treatment due to patient exposure to ionizing radiation.

Diagnosis
Erythema disappears on finger pressure (blanching), whereas purpura or bleeding in the skin and pigmentation do not. There is no temperature elevation, unless it is associated with the dilation of arteries in the deeper layer of the skin.
