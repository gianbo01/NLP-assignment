Early pregnancy loss

Early pregnancy loss is a medical term that when referring to humans can variously be used to mean:

Death of an embryo or fetus during the first trimester. This can happen by implantation failure, miscarriage, embryo resorption, early fetal resorption or vanishing twin syndrome.
Death of an embryo or fetus before 20 weeks gestation, as in all pregnancy loss before it becomes considered stillbirth.

Causes of early pregnancy loss
Pregnancy loss, in many cases, occurs for unknown reasons, often involving random chromosome issues during conception. Miscarriage is not caused by everyday activities like working, exercising, or having sex. Even falls or blows are rarely to blame. Research on the effects of alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine on miscarriage is inconclusive, so it's not something you could have prevented. It's crucial not to blame yourself for a miscarriage, as it's not the result of anything you did or didn't do.

Symptoms of early pregnancy loss
The most prevalent indication of pregnancy loss is vaginal bleeding. In the later stages of pregnancy, a woman experiencing a stillbirth may cease to sense fetal movements. However, it's important to note that each type of pregnancy loss presents distinct symptoms, so it's essential to consult your healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis.
