It is available widely throughout Latin America, in a few Asian and African countries, and in Turkey.

Medical uses
EV/NETE is used as a combined injectable contraceptive to prevent pregnancy in women. It is given by intramuscular injection once a month.

Available forms
EV/NETE is available in the form of an oil solution containing 5 mg estradiol valerate (EV) and 50 mg norethisterone enantate (NETE).

Pharmacology
Pharmacodynamics
EV/NETE is a combination of EV, an estrogen, and NETE, a progestogen with weak androgenic activity.
Through its progestogenic activity, NETE has potent antigonadotropic effects and can inhibit fertility and suppress sex hormone levels. A single intramuscular injection of EV/NETE has been found to strongly suppress testosterone levels in men. Levels of testosterone decreased from ~503 ng/dL at baseline to ~30 ng/dL at the lowest point (–94%) which occurred at day 7 post-injection.

Pharmacokinetics
Peak levels of estradiol after an intramuscular injection of EV/NETE (5 mg/50 mg) are reached within 2 days and range from 232 to 428 pg/mL.

History
EV/NETE, along with estradiol cypionate/medroxyprogesterone acetate (EC/MPA; code name HRP-112), was developed by the World Health Organization. Both EV/NETE and EC/MPA became available in 1993.
