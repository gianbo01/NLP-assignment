Clinomorphism

Clinomorphism is the deliberate or unintentional simplification, alteration, or amplification of the term for a medical condition (usually for dramatic effect). A caricature to which those (or care providers for those) with the condition may object is an example of simplification, while frequent overuse of a medical term, in the absence of bona fide symptoms, might be considered an amplification.
