Cervical conization

Cervical conization refers to an excision of a cone-shaped portion of tissue from the mucous membrane of the cervix. Conization is used for diagnostic purposes as part of a biopsy and for therapeutic purposes to remove pre-cancerous cells (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) or early stage cervical cancer.Types include:
Cold knife conization (CKC)
Laser conization
Loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP)

Side effects
Cervical conization effectively reduces the risk of cancer developing or spreading but it causes an increased risk of premature birth in future pregnancies.The chances of cancer recurrence and premature birth depends on the type of conization. Cold knife conization is associated with 7% chance of the cancer recurring and 16% chance of premature birth, laser conisation comes with 6% cancer recurrence and 13% premature birth, and loop excision comes with 10% recurrence and 11% premature birth.
