Intertubercular plane

A lower transverse plane midway between the upper transverse and the upper border of the pubic symphysis; this is termed the intertubercular plane (or transtubercular), since it practically corresponds to that passing through the iliac tubercles; behind, its plane cuts the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra.
