Hypoplasia

Hypoplasia (from Ancient Greek ὑπo- hypo- 'under' + πλάσις plasis 'formation'; adjective form hypoplastic) is underdevelopment or incomplete development of a tissue or organ.  Although the term is not always used precisely, it properly refers to an inadequate or below-normal number of cells.  Hypoplasia is similar to aplasia, but less severe. It is technically not the opposite of hyperplasia (too many cells). Hypoplasia is a congenital condition, while hyperplasia generally refers to excessive cell growth later in life.  (Atrophy, the wasting away of already existing cells, is technically the direct opposite of both hyperplasia and hypertrophy.)
Hypoplasia can be present in any tissue or organ. It is descriptive of many medical conditions, including underdevelopment of organs such as:

Breasts during puberty
Testes in Klinefelter's syndrome
Ovaries in Fanconi anemia, gonadal dysgenesis, trisomy X
Thymus in DiGeorge syndrome
Labia majora in popliteal pterygium syndrome
Corpus callosum, connecting the two sides of the brain, in agenesis of the corpus callosum
Cerebellum caused by mutation in the reelin gene
Tooth caused by oral pathology, such as Turner's hypoplasia
Chambers of the heart in hypoplastic left heart syndrome and hypoplastic right heart syndrome
Optic nerve in optic nerve hypoplasia
Sacrum in sacral agenesis
Facial muscle in asymmetric crying facies
Thumb from birth
Lungs, often as a result of oligohydramnios during gestation or the existence of congenital diaphragmatic hernia
Small bowel in coeliac disease
Fingers and ears in harlequin-type ichthyosis
Mandible in congenital hypothyroidism
