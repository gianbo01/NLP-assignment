Oral administration

Oral administration is a route of administration whereby a substance is taken through the mouth, swallowed, and then processed via the digestive system. This is a common route of administration for many medications.
Oral administration can be easier and less painful than other routes of administration, such as injection. However, the onset of action is relatively low, and the effectiveness is reduced if it is not absorbed properly in the digestive system, or if it is broken down by digestive enzymes before it can reach the bloodstream. Some medications may cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea or vomiting, when taken orally. Oral administration can also only be applied to conscious patients, and patients able to swallow.

Terminology
Per os (; P.O.) is an adverbial phrase meaning literally from Latin "through the mouth" or "by mouth". The expression is used in medicine to describe a treatment that is taken orally (but not used in the mouth such as, for example, caries prophylaxis). The abbreviation P.O. is often used on medical prescriptions.

Buccal, dissolved inside the cheek
Sublabial, dissolved under the lip
Sublingual administration (SL), dissolved under the tongue, but due to rapid absorption many consider SL a parenteral routeEnteral medications come in various forms, including oral solid dosage (OSD) forms:
Tablets to swallow, chew or dissolve in water or under the tongue
