Sopor (sleep)

Sopor is a condition of abnormally deep sleep or a stupor from which it is difficult to rouse a person. It involves a profound depression of consciousness, which is manifested by drowsiness, while maintaining coordinated defensive reactions to stimuli such as pain, harsh sound, and bright light, and preserving vital functions. Sopor may be caused by a drug; such drugs are deemed soporific. A stupor is more severe than a sopor.The name is derived from Latin sopor (cognate with the Latin noun somnus and the Greek noun ὐπνος, hypnos).
