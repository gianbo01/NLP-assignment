Estradiol undecylate/norethisterone enanthate

Estradiol undecylate/norethisterone enanthate (EU/NETE) is a combination medication of estradiol undecylate (EU), an estrogen, and norethisterone enanthate (NETE), a progestin, which was developed by Schering for potential use as a combined injectable contraceptive in women but was ultimately never marketed. It contained 5 to 10 mg EU and 50 to 70 mg NETE in oil solution and was intended for use by intramuscular injection at regular intervals. Although never commercialized, EU/NETE was found to be effective and well tolerated.
